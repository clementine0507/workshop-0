## question
Why does the circle have a tail(shadow)

### reflection
I will write all my notes in English after I finish learning all the courses. Currently, I am using my native language for convenience in studying, and I apologize for that.
I found the names of the circle functions on the reference website and used an ‘if’ loop to add a small animation. However, what I don’t understand is why a shadow is left along the path that the circle travels, and I haven’t been able to identify the issue so far.
